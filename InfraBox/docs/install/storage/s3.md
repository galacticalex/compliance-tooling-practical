# S3
InfraBox requires some object store to persist data. You may use any S3 compatible storage. If you already have a S3 compatible object store you can use it. If not see [use Minio](./minio.md) how you can setup one.

When installing with `helm` later on set these options:

```yaml
storage:
    s3:
        # Enabled S3
        enabled: true

        # Region
        region: # <REQUIRED>

        # Regeion endpoint
        endpoint: # <REQUIRED>

        # Region endpoint port
        port: 443

        # If https should be used or not
        secure: true

        # Bucket name
        bucket: # <REQUIRED>

        # AWS Access Key ID
        access_key_id: # <REQUIRED>

        # AWS Secret Access Key
        secret_access_key: # <REQUIRED>
```
